    question: 'Who is this book for?',
    answer: `This book is for developers and software architects who have some prior knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
and now want to get the most out of these technologies in terms of productivity, design quality, and scalability.
Software professionals with intermediate experience in Node.js and JavaScript will also find valuable the more advanced
patterns and techniques presented in this book.`
  },
  {
    question: 'I am new to JavaScript and Node.js, is this book for me?',
    answer: `This book assumes that you have an intermediate understanding of JavasScript, web application development,
databases, and software design principles. If you are new to JavaScript but you are familiar with other languages and
technologies this book can still be a valuable resource for you but we do recommend you to get familiar with the
basics of JavaScript first.
Some good FREE resources you could check out are [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net),
[JavaScript introduction by W3C](https://www.edx.org/course/javascript-introduction) and
[JavaScript in 30 days](https://javascript30.com/).`
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the main concepts I will learn in this book?',
    answer: `This book will get you comfortable with writing asynchronous code by leveraging **callbacks**, **promises**,
and the **async/await** syntax, leverage Node.js **streams** to create data-driven asynchronous processing pipelines,
implement well-known software design patterns to create production grade applications, share code between Node.js 
and the browser and take advantage of full-stack JavaScript. Finally, this book will teach you how to build and scale 
**microservices** and **distributed systems** powered by Node.js and how to use Node.js in conjunction with other powerful
technologies such as Redis, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and LevelDB.`

  {
    question: 'Can I download Node.js Design Patterns for FREE?',
    answer: `**No**. Node.js Design Patterns is the result of countless hours of hard work by the authors, the reviewers and 
many professionals at Packt, so we simply can't afford to give it away for free. If you want to have a feeling about the
quality of the content in the book, you can [download Chapter 9: Behavioural Design Patterns](#sample-chapter) for FREE.
You can also check out for FREE all the code examples available in the book on
[the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Node.js-Design-Patterns-Third-Edition).`
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is the book?',
    answer: 'The book has 13 chapters totaling about 660 pages.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I have to read all 660 pages to make sense of the book?',
    answer: `The book was written to give you continuity throughout the chapters so that you can enjoy reading the book from 
the first to the very last page. Although, if you are already familiar with many Node.js concepts and design patterns, 
you can easily skim through the chapters and focus only on the content that matters the most to you. Check out the 
[Table of Contents](#book-chapters) if you want to have a better feeling on how the book is structured.`

  {
    question: 'How up to date is this book?',

recent Node.js LTS version (**Node.js 14**). Node.js Design Patterns (third edition) leverages modern best practices and 
Node.js features such as **Async/Await** and **EcmaScript Modules (ESM)**.`
